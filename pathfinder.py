An implemenation of a breadth-first-search pathfinding algorithm. The pathfinder can be
configured in many ways, but the default configuration leads to the use of the A* pathfinding
algorithm (say 'A-star').

A well known configuration is the lazy breadth first search algorithm, better known under the
name of Dijkstra's algorithm. This configuration is more optimal when the requirement is to
find the shortest possible path. However, this configuraiont is the least optimal when the
requirement is to use the least possible iterations. Dijkstra's algorithm basically explores
the surroundings by staying as close as possible to the starting point. This leads to many
iterations, but always the shortest path.

Another well known configuration is the greedy breadth first search algorithm. Instead of
staying close to the starting point, this algorithm rather keeps the estimated route length
to the endpoint as small as possible. This leads to finding a path in a very little amount of
iterations, but it may not always find the shortest path.

A* combines the two algorithms by keeping the weighted sum of the traveled route length and
the estimated distance to the end point as small as possible. Weighting of both values is
based on the priority of both values. If the priority of a shorter path is higher than the
priority of less iterations, the traveled route is weighted more. If the priority of less
iterations is higher than the priority of the shortest path, the estimated distance is
weighted more.

The algorithm is based on recursive searching, but recursive searching requires depth-first
searching and that will not work except if the grid is limited. Also, DFS will not work if
there is a specific order in which individual branches need to be explored.

In the algorithm, we use an open list and a closed list. We fill these with nodes. Each node
has a parent node, except the node at the starting point. Parent nodes are always in the
closed list. Nodes in the closed list never mutate, while nodes in the open list may change
their parents and therefore their priority of being explored earlier or later. Nodes in the
closed list are considered as explored. Nodes in the open list are considered candidates to
be explored. Nodes in the open list have a priority of being explored. These priorities
become higher as the weights of the nodes become lower (so, heavier nodes sink deeper in the 
queue and thus have less priority). The pathfinding is then simply done by moving the open
node with the highest priority to the closed list. This is repeated until either no open
nodes are left (the start point is trapped), when the iteration limit is reached, or when an
endpoint is in the open list. When the endpoint node is in the open list, the route is found.

See pathfindertest.py for an example of how to use this pathfinder algorithm.

# Node represents a pathfinding node. This is either a node in the open list or a node in the
# closed list. A node is a pair of coordinates and, except if this is the root node, a parent
# node.
#
# There are 9 fields in this class:
# - grid:              We store the grid we are pathfinding on so that we can retrieve the 
#                      movement cost at our node once we need to compute our weight. We only 
#                      use this value if we are not the root node (if we are, we are the 
#                      start point so we have already been moved to that place).
# - coords:            This is our pair of coordinates, in a tuple: (x, y).
# - parent:            This is our parent. If we are the root node (starting point), we have
#                      no parent and this field is None. 
# - estimatedDistance: The estimated distance to the nearest endpoint: H. This value is set
#                      in the setEstimated weight is not computed by the node itself: the 
#                      pathfinding context computes this for us.
# - traveledDistance:  The distance we have traveled to get here: G. This is 0 if we are the
#                      root node (starting point). If we are not the root node, it is
#                      computed by taking the same value of our parent and adding the cost
#                      to move here (we can get this cost right away from the grid).
# - weigth:            This is our total weight: F. This value is computed by getWeights, by
#                      computing G + H (see the above two fields).
# - validated:         This is a tricky one: it stores whether our weight values are up to
#                      date. We set this to False when our parent has been updated. Once we 
#                      have called updateWeights, we may safely set it back to True. When we
#                      call getWeights while the node is validated (this field is true), we
#                      can save time by just skipping any calculation because our values were
#                      up to date according to this field: they will not change after all,
#                      even if we had done the calculations.
#                      At construction time, we are definitely invalid, therefore the initial
#                      value of this field is False.
# - id:                The ID of this node. The ID is 0 for a root node and every node that
#                      is created later in a pathfinding operation gets this value one larger
#                      than the previously created node. This value is used to determine the
#                      next open node to check out: the one with the highest ID and the 
#                      lowest weight is eventually the node that is being chosen.
# - weightCalc:        A function that computes the weight of nodes: it computes F. This
#                      function must take exactly two arguments: G and H. In A*, this
#                      function defaults to calculating G + H.

# Pathfinder is a class that stores the pathfinding context and runs the actual pathfinding
# algorithm. The Pathfinder class specifies 5 fields:
# - grid:              The grid we are pathfinding on. We query this grid for computing the
#                      movement costs of nodes.
# - start:             The starting point. The algorithm begins finding a path from this
#                      point. The starting point is specified as a tuple of coordinates:
#                      (x, y).
# - endpoints:         A set of endpoints. The algorithm tries to find the easiest path to
#                      one of the endpoints. The endpoint that is reached first is the
#                      endpoint the computed path leads to. If no endpoints are specified,
#                      a pathfinding operation moves directly into the failed state.
# - distanceEstimator: A function that estimates the length of the path between two points.
#                      The better the estimation, the more optimal the algorithm works.
# - weightCalculator:  A function that calculates the total weight (F) of a node, given the G
#                      and H values.
# A pathfinder can be used to find a path multiple times, but it's state should not change
# during an operation. Changing the state during an operation may lead to undefined
# behaviour of the pathfinding operation.

    # This method does the actual pathfinding algorithm. This is basically done by moving the
    # next queued open node to the closed list, repeatingly until the algorithm has entered
    # the end or failed state. If the algorithm reaches the end state, the node that found an
    # endpoint is followed up until the root node, prepending the coordinates of each node to
    # a list. The resulting list specifies the found path from the starting point to one of
    # the endpoints.
    # This method returns a dictionary holding the following keys:
    # - failed:     A boolean that is True when the algorithm ended up in a failed state. If
    #               the algorithm ended up in the finished state, this boolean is False.
    # - iterations: The amount of iterations the pathfinder took to get into a finished or a
    #               failed state. If the algorithm failed because no endpoints were
    #               specified, this value is -1.
    # - endpoint:   The endpoint that the found path leads to, or None if the algorithm ended
    #               up in the failed state.
    # - pathCoords: The coordinates of the found path, ordered from start to end. If the
    #               algorithm failed to find a path, this value is an empty list: [].
    # An optional parameter maxItr specifies how many iterations may be taken to find a path.
